Sqk is a Mac OS X command-line utility for automatic classification of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) written in Python. It integrates feature extraction (using the YAAFE feature extraction toolbox), supervised learning algorithms (using the Orange library [2]), and data analysis. It can also be used to resample ultrasonic vocalization such that they can be heard by a human.

Even though Sqk was originally created for classification of mouse USVs, it aims to provide a simple and versatile solution to supervised learning problems in any animal model. It includes options for different classification algorithms, including naive bayes, k-nearest neightbors, classification trees, and support vector machines.

Sqk is still in development. Future versions will include tools for statistical analysis.
